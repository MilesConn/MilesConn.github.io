Good question, I'm wondering much the same. During the first few\nweeks of my Modern Architecture class my Professor presented us with the\nfollowing quote by Nikolaus Pevsner\n\n> A bicycle shed is a building; Lincoln Cathedral is a piece of architecture.\n> Nearly everything that encloses space on a scale sufficient for a human being\n> to move in is a building; the term architecture applies only to buildings\n> designed with a view to aesthetic appeal.\n\nFor those reading at home, Nikolaus Pevsner is not an architect. By his logic\nmaybe that makes him a builder who knows?\n\nThe point is, it was supposed to impress upon us that is there is\n*Architecture*, and then there's whatever anyone who isn't an *Architect* is\ndoing (note the capital *A*). When I was presented with this quote I was really\noffended. I was one of the only two non-architects in the class. Maybe I took it\npersonally because Nikolaus was saying I was chopped liver. Either way I raised\nmy hand and I asked the Professor essentially, \"Why isn't a bike shed\narchitecture?\" Of course, part of my motivation was practical - the bike shed\nshown to us was quite nice in my\n*peasant-wouldn't-waste-my-precious-modernist-spittle* opinion. We went back and\nforth a bit, I dropped the subject, and then we moved on. Fine.\n\nThis was Thursday. On to Friday like a Good Jewish boy (GJB™) I was at Shabbat\nDinner. Nevermind, that I was pregaming with the rabbi, when I sat down all this\nacademia was in the back of my mind. I was of course sitting nonchalantly\ntheorizing on what really makes a *Rabbi* vs. a *rabbi*, any schmuck can read\ntoyrah, when a friend spoke to me. What follows is an exaggerated memory that I\nclaim to be verbatim:\n\n> Friend: You totally blew your cover you know.\n>\n> Me: What do you mean?\n>\n> F: Well now he knows you're not an architect.\n>\n> M: How?\n>\n> F: You broke the cardinal rule of architecture school\n\nI'm sure you can infer the rest. I exposed my hand, that I'm not the son of\nroyalty in fact I'm the son of\n*peasant-wouldn't-waste-my-precious-modernist-spittle* whatever. Anyhow, I was\nshocked. I felt like I had stepped onto the greatest architecture conspiracy\nsince (I can't find anything funny to say here so infer - maybe why they keep\nthe lights on in under construction/office buildings). You can imagine all\nthe emotions I was going through. Obviously I was devastated.\n\nJust kidding, I thought that was quite silly and then I moved on to theorizing\nand formalizing exactly what makes Shabbat chicken so good.\n\nThe following Saturday I awoke in a manic daze and wrote out the following\nessay. I had to type it out on an iPad in bed (don't tell **G**). Anyways, after\nhaving rambled and thinking I wrote the next greatest critique since that one on\nReason I went back to slumber. I then proceeded to lose the essay. Having\nthought this was lost forever I wasn't too sad. However, having found it I'm\nreally quite excited to share it.\n\nI know there are many typos. The typos are there to convey the absolute fury I\nwas expressing myself with. During my shabbat sleep my subconscious clearly\ndidn't take the day off. The typos are also there because I only have the\nattention span to read things once - I'm actually a DFA pretending to be Turing\nComplete AMA. This is the part where you and I both pretend I'll come back in\nthe future to fix them.\n\nBone Apple Teeth!\n\n## On Walmart.\n\nSo a bike shed is not a piece of architecture because it doesn't have aesthetic\nappeal. Well I challenge this on two fronts. Let's discuss Walmart. Architects\nlove to deride engineers as completely lacking any form of aesthetic taste. But\nis it not true that everyone has their own form of aesthetic taste even if they\nare classically trained (remember we are the classics). After all isn't\naesthetics to some degree just what you like. To continue this let's look at\nWalmart. First and an iconic feature is the parking lot. There are many cars\nwith many different variations of the same usuL color , black, grey, white and\nassuming they All cost the same didn't the owners make an aesthetic choice? Then\nin some walmarts they're the dreary planters in the lots with half dead trees.\nSure this is a long shot from thorreaus vision of America but isn't this too an\naesthetic choice? The lowly construction engineer could've totally overlooked\nthem and probably poured some concrete and saved some money in their place! Now\nlet's turn to Walmart. If there were no aesthetics in construction engineering\nthen Walmart could take on a million different forms but they all seem to look\nthe same. First there is the logo which was designed intentionally by a team of\ndesigners who probably when them critiques. Then there is the Walmart itself\nwhich most likely experiences iterations. The constructions engineers choose to\nplace the doors in the center, a ulutirairn move no doubt, but also an aesthetic\none that respects symmetry one of those timeless and eternal concepts Baudelaire\ninsisted on. Then you enter the Walmart and there's employees wearing uniforms\nthat bear a chosen corporate color. There are products with visuals and\nprospective buyers, the not classically trained, the other, go around and are\nvisually enticed. Ultimately when they make a choice they're in part saying I\nlike this one because of its design, they made an aesthetic choice! They weigh\ncompeting products in their hand and feel them and their texture and to borrow a\nword from architecture the products are undergoing a critique. In a way a\nWalmart is a pool of aesthetics with competing products clustered in a warehouse\nall designed by industrial designers or real designers or maybe unemployed\narchitects. And the end user, who is most important, has to go about nd make all\nthese aesthetic choices and if they can't do that they'll never escape Walmart.\nAnd sure eisenmann and the like would protest Walmart and that's fine. But I\ndoubt when some of these people return to their houses they wish they could live\nin eisenmann’is house number 6. And if ultimately no one wants to live in your\nhouse didn't you fail the assignment almost by definition? I'm worried that the\nidea that the idea that there is architecture and then there is engineering\ndeprives the engineer of his own sense of aesthetics which I think everyone has.\nAnd I'm worried that this will lead architecture down a road to an ivory tower\nthat happened in philosophy or comparative literature. And while these fields\nare interesting they're so far abstracted from reality they are anti pragmatic.\nAnd there is a time and a place for all these lofty ideas but they're is also\nand should and most importantly should often be a time and a place for pragmatic\nideas. Because without pragmatism the workers who built the pyramids would have\nno place to live. What is the role of architecture in this sense? What if\narchitecture instead of dotting our lAndscape with falling waters and case\nstudies number xx, essentially raising the ceiling for what can be done what if\nit raised the floor. What if we told the common man you can have your McMansion\nor your psusdo American style suburban home but we’re going to come in and make\nit architecturally good. We won't change the aesthetic to the white box but\nwe’ll get rid of.… because the point that simmel made is we are all experiencing\nmodernism. Those people are also experiencing modernism and they're experiencing\nthe same anxiety. And I think they're a happy place in the middle where\narchitecture Cana be not tyrnnaical and lend a hand to them. Improve our\nlandscape remove the eyesores. Alleviate the pressures we all feel from\nmodernism and Modernism. What if every house on beeler were a good place for\nstudents to be students, a machine for living if you will.\n\n"},{"slug":"you-need-to-be-playing-the-meta-game","category":"blog","title":"You Need to be Playing the Meta Game","description":"Some thoughts on the design process","tags":["design"],"body":"\nFor some reason or another multiple people have asked me what it takes to become a good product manager. Usually I respond with what I think is a more generalized answer, what it takes to be a good designer. In this post I want to generalize that answer even further. I also want to preface this with, I'm not a designer. I don't have any formal qualifications. This is my own opinion as a Certified Technology User™.\n\n## What it Takes to be a Good Designer\n\nI think great design comes from the iterative process of reflecting on how something makes you feel. When we talk about design school, or architecture school, or books, or teachings etc. we're often talking about formalizing how to talk about design. We're also getting people into the practice of how to navigate out of local maxima. However, all of these skills and words still render you hopeless if you can't uncover your emotions in relationship to what is being designed.\n\nBy no means do I want this to come across as knocking the formal practice or study of design. A formal language is very important. Without it you have a map you can't read. However, a formal language can only take you so far.\n\nWhen I first took architecture classes in university I was put off by the seeming disdain held for lay people. Lay people experience architecture much like architects. However, without the formal language they're stuck putting to words why they feel uncomfortable, unwelcomed, small, inhuman. In the same environment a good architect could point to and use words to pinpoint those feelings to real architectural details that can be molded and changed.\n\nAs I said before design school can often get you unstuck. In fact, I think a lot of school is just practicing getting unstuck while problem solving. A function of school is to get you to do this in a nourishing environment with the training wheels on. In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance this getting stuck is referred to as mental traps - I think, I haven't read the book for quite some years. I'm by no means a chess master but if you want to get good at chess it's often recommended you _grind_ tactics which means solving chess puzzles. Chess is a vast game with a gigantic game space and it's doubtful you'll ever see the exact puzzle again. However, by grinding puzzles you practicing the art pruning your decision tree which is a skill you can apply anywhere in your game. Another example from my own domain of expertise is programming language choice. Often when you speak to people who are getting started with programming they'll ask you which language to choose or which language is best. Sometimes Junior Engineers will worry that they need to study another language to get a new job. This is missing the fact that programming languages exist in a family. Once you learn to see the patterns and the ways of thinking they spring up everywhere. At a certain level understanding and being good in one language carries over to everywhere else, same with tactic solving. All this to say that formal education, especially 'problem solving', can help you get out of being stuck but I don't think it's necessary.\n\nAsking and answering how am I feeling is no easy feat. It's also totally unrelated to the hard technical skills drawing or designing. This orthogonality is probably why there are often great designers/visionaries who don't have formal backgrounds or if they do can easily translate them to a new medium. I would say they mastered the meta game which I've laid out as\n\n1. How do I get unstuck.\n2. How does this make me feel.\n\nI think both are challenging but I think the \"how does this make me feel\" is hardest because I don't think you can master it in an academic setting, you have to go elsewhere. While small there have been times where I rearranged my desk or move a lamp. The sense of bliss I felt afterwards realizing that the previous arrangement had been bothering me but language describing the frustration was stuck somewhere in my subconscious. This is another reason to learn or at least engage the formal language. While this is a toy example if I don't have the words to say that the arrangement of my desk is what's causing my frustration I'm less actualized in being able to fix it. Of course, I can't always be poking wordless but it's not as effective as being armed with the right tools in the toolbox. It'd be like trying to hammer in a screw without even knowing that screw drivers exists, yet another reason to go to school or at least have some education. I feel there are countless personal examples I have, all tiny, where my life got better once I was able to pinpoint and solve my frustration of some designed thing I interact with....\n\nWithout being too discriminatory I've always noted when an architect or designer doesn't dress well. [[Fashion]] is a hugely complicated subject but I'm surprised when supposedly I'm supposed to be trusting someone who's an expert in aesthetics and they don't apply that same problem solving elsewhere. I don't think we should discriminate on these grounds alone, people are allowed to leave their work at the door but it does make me question if they're playing the meta game.\n\nI think there are other things I can say about the meta game, obsession might be a green flag, there's this [post by Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/) where he highlights that getting good at getting good is a skill that can be practiced, once again the meta game. Anyways, I wish I could leave you with some advice on how to get better at either part, especially reflecting on your emotions. Therapy? Who knows, that's half the battle. Sometimes I think back to a conversation I had with my manager where he said to me,\n\n> It seems that you want a shortcut to years of experience when there's no way to do that beyond just having the years of experience\n"}]
