title: Is Simulation Theory in BQP?!?
---


I decided that since I'm not actively writing anything I might as well have a
page where I take down some things I want to investigate and that\'ll keep be
accountable ...

## Upcoming Articles

Stay tuned y'all I have some exciting stuff coming up. Recently I've been
reading this book [Quantum Computing Since
Democritus](https://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9781107302105)
by [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/) (amazing blog name
might I add). If you were interested in the physics or computing hardware
necessary for quantum computing this book isn't for you. But if you wanted to
learn that **NP** doesn't stand for **not**-*polynomial* then you might enjoy
this book. 

One takeaway I want to write about when I'm done is about [simulation
theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESXOAJRdcwQ). George Hotz is not the
only person who's into simulation theory (see that guy named Musk) but I think
he's certainly one of the smarter ones in the pack. I'm just wondering if he's
considered if simulation theory is even computable. I think if we look at the
[Bekenstein Bound](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bekenstein_bound) that might
provided some evidence into the possibility of simulation theory. 

More thoughts coming soon!

## Ideas to Investigate 

1. Aghhh I'm looking for a paper that I want to say was by Feynman (9/19 The
   paper in question is More is Different by P. W. Anderson) about
   emergent properties of complex systems. I'm sure it's somewhere. Anyways I'm
   want to bring it up to propose *Scale vs. Computability* as one possible
   angle to approach the above problem. Stephen Wolfram is working on a unified
   Theory of Physics right now. One possible argument against such a thing even
   existing I think lies somewhere in the Anthropomorphic Principle. For
   instance, take income inequality. Law of Averages $\dots$ Clearly there are
   emergent properties in these systems that emerge from being simulated.


2. Ugh pt2. In my lecture my Professor brought up the Musk argument that video
   game 50 years ago were super simple and in 50 years they could be
   indistinguishable from reality. This got  me thinking about two things
   1. Tool-Assisted Speedruns - it's obvious that if there exists a QM M that
      simulates our world that it doesn't have to worry about how fast it can be
      because it could simply be doing a Tool-Assited Speedrun of our world
      where it stops time, computes, and then moves on

      2. Musk's relies on the word indistinguishable from reality which does not
         mean reality itself.
