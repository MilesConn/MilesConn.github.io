title: What I Want the Internet to be
---

This is a big question and I want to discuss different things I've been thinking
about with regards to it

### Should there be a higher barrier to entry?

Is there such a thing as too accessible?

aaaaarg.fail


### (My) This Platform isn't For Fascists 

When I was 


### Gab.com vs dreadditevelidot.onion

#### What is Gab.com 

#### What is dreadditevelidot.onion? 
    **dread.onion** is a reddit-like hidden service running on the dark net.
    (Note there's like a million different URLs for Dread)
   

### What I think

I always joke that I think the internet should be. I say it should be a bunch of
kibbutzim of 150 people communicating with each other over IRC.
