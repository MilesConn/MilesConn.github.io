: On Politics

Uh. The current state of America is making me nauesous. For so many reasons. For
one, it just hurts to identify as an American. If you read any history ever I
think there's definitely a lot left to be desired with the American legacy.
That's undoubtable true. However, America today just shocks me.

There's a common thing that pops up that when people talk about politics that
follows a template of 

> "everything would be better if [foo] were [bar]"

And you can attack this phrase from a rhetorical standpoint. You can question
the use of the word 'everything'. You can add nuance, and say "at least %50"
better. You can qualify the conditional and instead of it being absolute 1 or 0
you can say we could make a step in the right direction. 

I feel this meta political statement provides a pretty good template for at
least everything in the [Overton

, more or less.

I'm going to tack on my own "if this then better" political statement.

I think we should do our very best, to limit our communities to 150 people or
less.

I see this playing out one of two ways 

1. You immediately only ever have to interact with 150 people
