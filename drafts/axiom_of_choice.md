title: A little bit on the Axiom of Choice
---

So recently I've been returning to set theory which seems to be the foundation
of all mathematics. I want to give my own take on the ever-so famous Axiom
of Choice.

The Axiom of Choice is kinda a mysterious thing. Lay people (including myself)
read the wikipedia page and think that it's proven the obvious. And it has. In
essence all it's saying is it's possible to choose something from every set.
However, like all the axioms in math their simplicity is deceiving. The Axiom of
Choice seems to have grave reprucussions.
