# Who am I 

My name is Miles Conn. I'm currently a student at Carnegie Mellon University.
Sometimes, I live in New York. 

# Blog?

Wow a blogâ€½ Who would have thought. Yes I know I agree amazing I have a blog.
How does it work you might ask? I'm using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
for hosting and [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) for converting the
markdown to static html. Why this is such a complicated effort I'm unsure of.
I'm thinking of rolling my own solution later but for now, this kinda works. 

# FAQ

There are no frequently asked questions but I thought I'd anticipate some
anyways.

1. What do you blog about?

    I'm not sure. There is no set schedule for what or when I blog. I'm more keeping
this as a personal diary about things I found out and want to talk about. I will
say I've noticed since Freshman year the quality of my writing has severely
tanked and so I think it's kinda good for me to be writing again.

2. I have no further questions

    That's fine, I wasn't intending on answering anymore.

If you want to send me email you can use the following.

I have a unjustified paranoia of bots scarping my site for my email so until I
get [JS
obfuscation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/748780/best-way-to-obfuscate-an-e-mail-address-on-a-website)
working we're stuck with this.
