Well I challenge this on two fronts. Let's discuss Walmart. Architects\nlove to deride engineers as completely lacking any form of aesthetic taste. But\nis it not true that everyone has their own form of aesthetic taste even if they\nare classically trained (remember we are the classics). After all isn't\naesthetics to some degree just what you like. To continue this let's look at\nWalmart. First and an iconic feature is the parking lot. There are many cars\nwith many different variations of the same usuL color , black, grey, white and\nassuming they All cost the same didn't the owners make an aesthetic choice? Then\nin some walmarts they're the dreary planters in the lots with half dead trees.\nSure this is a long shot from thorreaus vision of America but isn't this too an\naesthetic choice? The lowly construction engineer could've totally overlooked\nthem and probably poured some concrete and saved some money in their place! Now\nlet's turn to Walmart. If there were no aesthetics in construction engineering\nthen Walmart could take on a million different forms but they all seem to look\nthe same. First there is the logo which was designed intentionally by a team of\ndesigners who probably when them critiques. Then there is the Walmart itself\nwhich most likely experiences iterations. The constructions engineers choose to\nplace the doors in the center, a ulutirairn move no doubt, but also an aesthetic\none that respects symmetry one of those timeless and eternal concepts Baudelaire\ninsisted on. Then you enter the Walmart and there's employees wearing uniforms\nthat bear a chosen corporate color. There are products with visuals and\nprospective buyers, the not classically trained, the other, go around and are\nvisually enticed. Ultimately when they make a choice they're in part saying I\nlike this one because of its design, they made an aesthetic choice! They weigh\ncompeting products in their hand and feel them and their texture and to borrow a\nword from architecture the products are undergoing a critique. In a way a\nWalmart is a pool of aesthetics with competing products clustered in a warehouse\nall designed by industrial designers or real designers or maybe unemployed\narchitects. And the end user, who is most important, has to go about nd make all\nthese aesthetic choices and if they can't do that they'll never escape Walmart.\nAnd sure eisenmann and the like would protest Walmart and that's fine. But I\ndoubt when some of these people return to their houses they wish they could live\nin eisenmann’is house number 6. And if ultimately no one wants to live in your\nhouse didn't you fail the assignment almost by definition? I'm worried that the\nidea that the idea that there is architecture and then there is engineering\ndeprives the engineer of his own sense of aesthetics which I think everyone has.\nAnd I'm worried that this will lead architecture down a road to an ivory tower\nthat happened in philosophy or comparative literature. And while these fields\nare interesting they're so far abstracted from reality they are anti pragmatic.\nAnd there is a time and a place for all these lofty ideas but they're is also\nand should and most importantly should often be a time and a place for pragmatic\nideas. Because without pragmatism the workers who built the pyramids would have\nno place to live. What is the role of architecture in this sense? What if\narchitecture instead of dotting our lAndscape with falling waters and case\nstudies number xx, essentially raising the ceiling for what can be done what if\nit raised the floor. What if we told the common man you can have your McMansion\nor your psusdo American style suburban home but we’re going to come in and make\nit architecturally good. We won't change the aesthetic to the white box but\nwe’ll get rid of.… because the point that simmel made is we are all experiencing\nmodernism. Those people are also experiencing modernism and they're experiencing\nthe same anxiety. And I think they're a happy place in the middle where\narchitecture Cana be not tyrnnaical and lend a hand to them. Improve our\nlandscape remove the eyesores. Alleviate the pressures we all feel from\nmodernism and Modernism. What if every house on beeler were a good place for\nstudents to be students, a machine for living if you will.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=o.exports}}]);
