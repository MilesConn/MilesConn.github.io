# WIP 

This is a *very* work in progess MVP of my personal blog that you can visit
[at](MilesConn.io). 

There are a lot of TODOs that exist in my head and a Figma design file that goes
with it that's not publicly shared. 

## Tentative TODO

These are some top level things

- [ ] Settle debate on astro vs svelte for svgs (I think I settled on astro but
  I forget)
- [ ] Add image caching to build pipeline 
- [ ] Setup build pipeline 
- [ ] Layout stuff 
- [ ] Get rid of logs in tree sitter --> this entails fixing the tree sitter

Feel free to fork but until I have the repo in a usable (and organized) state I
don't think I'll be able to accept outside PRs.
