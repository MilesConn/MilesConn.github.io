title: My TCS Final Paper
---

Agh! End of the semester. Right now I'm finishing the semester (actually putting
off studying for a final I failed) but I wanted to share a paper I wrote on PAC
learning. It's imperfect, it's flawed, I still don't understand the proof or the
intuition for the Blumer et al. Theorem is. However, I really enjoyed writing
it. Doing (copying) the proof for learning reductions was super interesting.
Writing this paper made the little voice in my head go, "hey, a PhD in
theoretical machine learning could be cool..." and then another voice in my head
went big words coming form a person who's afraid of committing to things.

Enjoy!
