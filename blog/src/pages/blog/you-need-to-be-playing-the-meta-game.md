For some reason or another multiple people have asked me what it takes to become a good product manager. Usually I respond with what I think is a more generalized answer, what it takes to be a good designer. In this post I want to generalize that answer even further. I also want to preface this with, I'm not a designer. I don't have any formal qualifications. This is my own opinion as a Certified Technology Userâ„¢.

## What it Takes to be a Good Designer

I think great design comes from the iterative process of reflecting on how something makes you feel. When we talk about design school, or architecture school, or books, or teachings etc. we're often talking about formalizing how to talk about design. We're also getting people into the practice of how to navigate out of local maxima. However, all of these skills and words still render you hopeless if you can't uncover your emotions in relationship to what is being designed.

By no means do I want this to come across as knocking the formal practice or study of design. A formal language is very important. Without it you have a map you can't read. However, a formal language can only take you so far.

When I first took architecture classes in university I was put off by the seeming disdain held for lay people. Lay people experience architecture much like architects. However, without the formal language they're stuck putting to words why they feel uncomfortable, unwelcomed, small, inhuman. In the same environment a good architect could point to and use words to pinpoint those feelings to real architectural details that can be molded and changed.

As I said before design school can often get you unstuck. In fact, I think a lot of school is just practicing getting unstuck while problem solving. A function of school is to get you to do this in a nourishing environment with the training wheels on. In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance this getting stuck is referred to as mental traps - I think, I haven't read the book for quite some years. I'm by no means a chess master but if you want to get good at chess it's often recommended you _grind_ tactics which means solving chess puzzles. Chess is a vast game with a gigantic game space and it's doubtful you'll ever see the exact puzzle again. However, by grinding puzzles you practicing the art pruning your decision tree which is a skill you can apply anywhere in your game. Another example from my own domain of expertise is programming language choice. Often when you speak to people who are getting started with programming they'll ask you which language to choose or which language is best. Sometimes Junior Engineers will worry that they need to study another language to get a new job. This is missing the fact that programming languages exist in a family. Once you learn to see the patterns and the ways of thinking they spring up everywhere. At a certain level understanding and being good in one language carries over to everywhere else, same with tactic solving. All this to say that formal education, especially 'problem solving', can help you get out of being stuck but I don't think it's necessary.

Asking and answering how am I feeling is no easy feat. It's also totally unrelated to the hard technical skills drawing or designing. This orthogonality is probably why there are often great designers/visionaries who don't have formal backgrounds or if they do can easily translate them to a new medium. I would say they mastered the meta game which I've laid out as

1. How do I get unstuck.
2. How does this make me feel.

I think both are challenging but I think the "how does this make me feel" is hardest because I don't think you can master it in an academic setting, you have to go elsewhere. While small there have been times where I rearranged my desk or move a lamp. The sense of bliss I felt afterwards realizing that the previous arrangement had been bothering me but language describing the frustration was stuck somewhere in my subconscious. This is another reason to learn or at least engage the formal language. While this is a toy example if I don't have the words to say that the arrangement of my desk is what's causing my frustration I'm less actualized in being able to fix it. Of course, I can't always be poking wordless but it's not as effective as being armed with the right tools in the toolbox. It'd be like trying to hammer in a screw without even knowing that screw drivers exists, yet another reason to go to school or at least have some education. I feel there are countless personal examples I have, all tiny, where my life got better once I was able to pinpoint and solve my frustration of some designed thing I interact with....

Without being too discriminatory I've always noted when an architect or designer doesn't dress well. [[Fashion]] is a hugely complicated subject but I'm surprised when supposedly I'm supposed to be trusting someone who's an expert in aesthetics and they don't apply that same problem solving elsewhere. I don't think we should discriminate on these grounds alone, people are allowed to leave their work at the door but it does make me question if they're playing the meta game.

I think there are other things I can say about the meta game, obsession might be a green flag, there's this [post by Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/) where he highlights that getting good at getting good is a skill that can be practiced, once again the meta game. Anyways, I wish I could leave you with some advice on how to get better at either part, especially reflecting on your emotions. Therapy? Who knows, that's half the battle. Sometimes I think back to a conversation I had with my manager where he said to me,

> It seems that you want a shortcut to years of experience when there's no way to do that beyond just having the years of experience
