So recently I got into a fairly heated argument with friends in a groupchat over
tikok. I was mainly responding to this [reddit
comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fxgi06/not_new_news_but_tbh_if_you_have_tiktiok_just_get/fmuko1m/)
which claims to have reverse-engineered tiktok... 

People in the groupchat were claiming that I was a hypocrite for using facebook
while criticizing their use of tik tok. And you know what, I think they're 
right. For reference, I was reluctant to use facebook but so much of highschool
and college felt like it depended upon it. As of today I've downloaded my
facebook data in a nice JSON format and I'm deactivating my account. 

## Fully Removing Myself

It's really difficult to fully unentangle myself from bad software. Steps I've
taken so far are I've switched to firefox over chrome (other options are to use
chromium, opera, etc.) and I've switched to Duck Duck Go for my search engine.

Future steps include:
1. Using  a vpn fulltime 
2. Going through all the accounts I've signed up with my email for and deleting
   those
3. Making a dummy email if I must use one
4. Clarifying my position

FOSS....
