: Anonymity and Minority and other words ending in -ity
---


The impetus for this post comes from a conversation I had with a friend and a reflection on recent events
(6/11/20). For variou stechnical reasons that we'll skip over I attended both The Bronx Highschool of Science 
and Stuyvesant Highschool. Two very competitive and selective *public* highschools in NYC. If you ranked schools on where they got kids into
college then these schools would easily rank in the top-10 in the country. Especially if you factor out athletic admits, legacy, and other special consideration based
admissions.

My point is Stuyvesant (and Bronx Science) both have a major issue with race. I'm not going to delve into it here you can read over it here
but the point is there are very very very few **PoC** students at either of these schools. Like, single digit levels. 

At the same time I saw on Instagram an infographic about Stuyvesant's race issue and it cited that there are something like 7 black students. I thought wow,
the pressure they must endure. Not only are they dealing with Stuyvesant and being a teenager and college and all of that but they don't really have any anonymity.
When people talk about black students at Stuyvesant or Bronx Science there's only so many kids they can be talking about. 

I would like to relate another story shared to me by a friend

> Type highkey My professor was talking about this Like [college] put out a survey An anonymous survey for professors to respond if they felt comfortable working on campus in the fall And they asked ethnicity and which building they worked in And my professor is Puerto rican And the only Hispanic person who works in his building So the survey was really only anonymous if you are white Its pretty fucked up and just another example of white privilege We just n r ver have to question if data is going to deanonymize us Well I mean sometimes I think about that just cause I'm a security nut But its not really a risk to me in comparison to minories and that type of data collection is so widely prevalent nowadays it requires yet another dimension of hypervigilence for minorities to keep themselves safe
