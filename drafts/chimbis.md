# Why Write Now?

Absolutely why write now. For one I think only one person knows the url to this blog. 
However the impetus for writing this blog is many fold

1. I can't sleep
2. I'm bored 

More so it's inspired by some recent happenings in social media

and I also want to incude a fascinating tirade by my friend Ryo Nishikubo colloquially 
known as __Chimbis__ 

> Bro participation is the new model for deterrence mdoern capital functions

> or "reality," it only makes our symbolic realm a more exact clone than the last,
> and in making it more exact, it becomes to exact in perfecting our many little

More on this later.
Finally if you're wondering how I formatted all of this so fast. **VIM**
it was as simple as 
~~~~~~~~~~~ vim
set textwidth=80, Visual-mode gq
begin,ends s/^/> /  
~~~~~~~~~~~
duh.
