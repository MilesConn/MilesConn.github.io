You might be wondering <em>sheesh</em> that sounds really complicated for such a simple blog.
And to that I'd say you're right. Way until you learn about JS, AWS, and the horde
of microservices that keep the web running at an ever slower pace. Honnorable mention

For one I think only one person knows the url to this blog.
However the impetus for writing this blog is many fold</p> <ol><li>I can't sleep</li> <li>I'm bored</li></ol> <p>More so it's inspired by some recent happenings in social media
<img src="tweet.jpg" alt="Image : You hate to see it"></p> <p>and I also want to incude a fascinating tirade by my friend Ryo Nishikubo colloquially
known as <strong>Chimbis</strong></p> <blockquote><p>Bro participation is the new model for deterrence mdoern capital functions
through the participation of the masses, its smooth continuation only possible
through the propogation of new truths, of new meanings and actions, of &quot;praxis&quot;
in order to preserve our faith in its existence in attempting to discover and
construct an exact truth, a perfected hologram of reality which no longer
represents, but totalizes the real, humanity has killed the possibility for
truth all together. Each degree of perfected science, of pataphysicality in our
understanding of the world, doesnt bring us closer to the asymptote of &quot;truth&quot;
or &quot;reality,&quot; it only makes our symbolic realm a more exact clone than the last,
and in making it more exact, it becomes to exact in perfecting our many little
truths, we have not found reality, but we have made a hyperreality, a perfected
universe of transparency which jumps past the necessary distance required to
allow reality, and finds itself in a world beyond meaning, in world beyond
reality, a simulated world in which informations and holograms reign an example
of this is the way companies use Search Engine optimisation to target users. The
mast quantity of data on the individual isn't simply &quot;representative&quot; but it is
totalized, it doesnt just describe the individual, but it overcodes and extends
past them.  the accelerated renewal of information on the subject, this
perfected, transparent image of who a person is can no longer be categorized in
terms of meaning, because that assumes a certain distance between the signifier
and signified a certain distinction between the symbolic and the real, which is
necessary for the existence of the two, and thus the existence of meaning itself
in erasing that distance through the perfected pataphysics of datafication, we
haven't achieved the asymptotic truth you describe, but instead stepped past
truth entirely, into a new universe one which has nothing to do with reality
becuase in being born, it required reality's death guy debord is also wrong bc
he still believes in the spectacle, the gaze, as the character of modern
capitalism it assumes that the subject, still existing, percieves the
&quot;spectacle&quot; of information and is seduced by it. But seduction is dead, it is no
longer this mystical &quot;trick&quot; or &quot;illusion&quot; that capital finds itself on, but a
operational and mechanical deconstruction and reconstruction of the subject
itself The subject isn't tricked into believing, they are REMADE to have already
believed, they are programmed to believe from the start, preempted in every way
possible.  just like how google's data is so all encompassign that it can
predict and even influence behaviours idenities are already constructed in temrs
of the programmed model for identity the &quot;vegan&quot; is socialized in terms of the
model &quot;vegan,&quot; the activist is socialized in terms of the model &quot;Activist&quot; the
programmed identity does not unfold by itself but is plotted out</p> <p>I see this text as being unattainable - ME</p> <p>to make it attainable is to attempt to create meaning but thats the double
bind we're in, we are taught to participate, to create meaning at every turn
like the 5 year plan but with fighting our selves because in the act of
creating meaning, of seeking truth more fervently, we are only making more
definite its death</p> <p>We are preserving temporarily our word of coherence, but in doing so rendering
its end entirely more inevitable Because everyone else still relies upon the
myth of meaning - ME</p> <p>you're right, the myth of meaning is what allows this process to implode on
itself to saturate across all fields of understanding, just like you
advocating for truth and for praxis and for engagement, it is a process that
is not avoidable but that is also where we might find our revolution, the
overcoming of capital As in this process of saturated information, in the
process of overproducing data, we bring ourselves closer to collapse where in
the past, revolution was found in explosive violence, our age now is that of
implosive violence, where signs which have been stacked and clustered and
reproduced obscenely finally implodes on itself I would argue that the riots
in minneapolis are an example of that the implosion of signs, of the
coroporate signage of power and control and consumerism, the sign of police
and state fascism, the signs of participatory activism, of protest, of
&quot;standing with black lives&quot; it all collapsed in on itself at the sight of the
riot the riot isn't participitory, but implosive implosive destruction born of
the utter overproduction of signs the participants themselves do not know the
significance of their movement, because this implosive force has nothing to do
with individual ideologies or politics, but it isn an inate condition of
modern capitalism that as we impldoe as individuals, as discrete and
meaningful subjects, into datafied models, the model itself implodes by means
of the masses</p> <p>And presenting to them this thesis of yours is seen as nonsense -ME</p> <p>I dont need to present the thesis for it to work implosion doesnt need
explanation to function, in fact to explain it, to seek to make it coherent,
accessible, etc would be to build upon the same supporting structures of
participatory acitvism, of meaning, which prevent this ultimate implosion.
that's why baudrillard seeks to revel in his incoherence, why he includes
eight different asides in each sentence, making it near impossible to read,
while simultaneously injecting vocabulary which is entirely unnecessary and
absurd the role of the philosopher is to riot</p> <p>lol fuck participating to push us towards this implosive line</p> <p>Nothing ? - me</p> <p>whatever would arise would be incoherent to us it would arise in
a world which has exceeded past meaning the violence capital exists on the
contradiction of asserted political &quot;truths&quot; in a system which intrinsically
undermines them</p></blockquote> <p>More on this later.
